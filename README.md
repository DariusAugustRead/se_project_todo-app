# Simple Todo App

I am learning the practical use of classes in my JS projects

## Functionality

As the name suggests, it is a simple todo list. New items can be added to the end of the list and any item can be deleted. While adding a new item, a date for when the task should be done can be selected, be it is not required. If a date is selected, it will be shown when the item task is created.
