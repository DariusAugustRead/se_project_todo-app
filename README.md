# Simple Todo App

I am building an editable TODO list using Javascript.

## Functionality

As the name suggests, it is a simple todo list. New items can be added to the end of the list and any item can be deleted. While adding a new item, a date for when the task should be done can be selected, be it is not required. If a date is selected, it will be shown when the item task is created on the main list.

## Technology

HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript ES6 are being used in the VS Code editor software. No Figma this time. I am learning how to use classes, importing and exporting methods and the "this." keyword.

## Deployment

This project is deployed by me on GitHub Pages:
